# Safe Shroom

This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning-based Mushroom Image Classification AI. The model is designed to distinguish between edible and poisonous mushrooms using image inputs, providing users with an easy way to assess mushroom safety.
Access the ai repository here! --> https://github.com/michlleee/SafeShroom-AI-model
## Features
- Image classification for edible and poisonous mushrooms
- Deep learning-based model trained on a labeled dataset
- User-friendly interface for uploading mushroom images
- Real-time predictions with confidence scores

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/michlleee/safe-shroom.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd safe-shroom
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Download the dataset (if applicable) and place it in the appropriate directory.

## Usage
To run the model and classify images:

```bash
python main.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
```

Alternatively, if the project includes a web interface:

```bash
python app.py
```
Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the interface.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing images of edible and poisonous mushrooms from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/derekkunowilliams/mushrooms. The dataset is preprocessed and augmented to improve accuracy.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – Main programming language  
- **TensorFlow** – Deep learning framework for the CNN model  
- **Flask** – Web framework for the user interface  
- **HTML/CSS** – Frontend for the upload interface  

## Model
- Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
- Trained using TensorFlow
- Accuracy above 70%
